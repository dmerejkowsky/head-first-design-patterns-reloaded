# Head First Design Patterns - Reloaded !

## The big idea

Re-implement patterns described in the "Head First Design Patterns" in other languages to explore what's going on when:

* You don't have class at all (like in Go or Rust)
* You're using a multi-paradigm language (like Python or Kotlin)

Just code here for now - maybe this will become something bigger on day ...
